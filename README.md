# Routly

Routly is a personal project designed for self-training in data structures and algorithms. The primary focus is on utilizing binary trees or tree algorithms to efficiently identify URL path matches.

## Examples

1. **Dynamic ID Matching:**
   - Path Template: `/users/{id}`
   - Example Path: `/users/thisIsID10`

2. **Strict Integer ID Matching:**
   - Path Template: `/users/{id:int}`
   - Example Path: `/users/1323`
